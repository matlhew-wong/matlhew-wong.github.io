                    <p>
                        Let me describe what the setting is right now for me.
                        It's 4:47 and I'm on the third floor of the Bahen Centre
                        for Information Technology. This is a terrible introduction
                        but just stay with me here. Finals season just means no class
                        but same amount of work and for me that's just weird. I like
                        going to class and without it, the extra time is just being
                        dedicated to stuff like this. Which brings me back to the
                        reason I'm up at 4:57. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who don't know me, go read my bio. If I havn't
                        put my bio up yet because I've passed out then all you need
                        to know is that I go to U of T and I'm terrible at writing,
                        English in general actually. So if you see any grammar or 
                        spelling mistakes, shoot me an email and I'll be sure to
                        do nothing about it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So back to what i'm doing. If I'm not studying, I'm
                        probably wasting time surfing the web and reading pointless
                        stuff. But recently, everyone's working hard to glitter 
                        themselves up so that they can get 'jobs'. Turns out the
                        stuff they teach us at U of T won't help you land a job so
                        you have to teach it yourself or something. I know it's weird.
                        Anyhow, that's what i'm doing right now. Collecting all the
                        average projects I've done over the years and present them
                        in a way that they make me look half decent. So if that's
                        one thing you get out of this mess of writing, prepare now
                        so you can sleep early in the future :)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So to sum up how I'm feeling right now in one sentence,
                        'I'm glad I didn't slip and fall from the ice outside'. You
                        thought I was going to say something inspirational. HA Jokes
                        on you. Try again next week. I'll try to post one of these
                        every week. If you want me to talk about anything, scream really loud
                        because I havn't set up any communication between me and you yet. 
                        I'm probably going to fix this tomorrow and half this stuff will be
                        gone so I don't know. Read or don't read I don't really care.
                        This is just really therapeutic for me. 
                    </p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
